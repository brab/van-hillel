Friends of Hillel

 

If you are interested in Jewish or Israeli culture, or just want to make sure you donâ€™t miss out on any of the diverse programs, speakers, educational or social events Vancouver Hillel offers, become a Friend of Hillel to receive our weekly message.

 

Friends of Hillel is open to anyone, on campus or off, Jewish or not, young or not so young. Anyone who is interested in our work is welcome to become a Friend of Hillel. It costs nothing, carries no obligation and ensures that you will be among the first to know when exciting events or activities are planned.
